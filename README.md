# Jump demo
Demonstration of a <i>reusable</i> and <i>modifiable</i> jumping implementation in a 2D-platformer-game.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a jumping script that can be reused in many platforming games by simply creating new jump-settings that affect the jumps look and feel. I've made a number of platforming games on my spare time where I spent alot of time implementing jumping that almost always turns out the same way.

In this implementation I've focused on <b>reusability</b> and <b>modifiability</b>, which further strengthens reusability.

## Jumping in platformers
In platformers it is not enough to simply add force upwards in order to simulate a jump. A jump that "looks" good does not necessarily "feel" good. Relying on forces may also result in inconsistent jumps, as any number of forces can affect the character at any given time. 


## Implementation
